# vsgIG
VulkanSceneGraph Image Geneartor SDK

## Mission

vsgIG will provide visual similators and games developers with a collection of commerical grade, open source libraries and utilities than aid the development of thie applications  The provide software will build upon the VulkanSCeneGraph, Vulkan, C++ and CMake and provide the a higher level member of the VulkanSceneGraph ecosysem. 

## Initial Plan

1. Create simple testbed applications for the major visual simulation domains, starting with flight and driving simulation testbeds.
2. Source test datasets to use with the testbed applications
3. Seek feedback from the OpenSceneGraph, VulkanSCeneGraph and wider vis-sim/game communities on feature required
4. As features are added to the testbeds opportunities to pull common features out into the vsgIG will be used to seed the development of the vsgIG library.
5. Areas where features are complex enough to warrent their own dedicated projects/repos will be spun out from the vsgIG to become external dependencies.

## How to contribute

1. Contributing time and expertiese as fellow open source developers
2. Commercial funding of the development of vsgIG features and asociated components
